# SOS_Bacteroidetes
Code for the analysis of the SOS network in the Bacteroidetes

The idea of this project is to elucidate the SOS response in the Bacteroidetes combining comparative genomics approaches with in vitro and in vivo analyses. The code located in this repository works (1) downloading the upstream regions of genes encoding desired proteins, (2) removing promoter redundancy and (3) performing motif discovery.
